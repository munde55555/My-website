<p>Bienvenidos a la fiesta لَو ضَاق صَدري قِلت مَا أطوَلكِ يَا ليل الله يعينَ اللي مفَارق حبيبَه ..
سَهران ليلِي أناظِر نَجمَة الليل والدَمعِ يسكُب مِن عينِي سكيبَـه ..
مَا أنسَاكِ لَو ينسَى الكِحِل سودَ الأهدَاب وكيف تنسَى العِين صَافِي نُظَرهَا ...!!!

  Suicide is not something that can be over looked. It is the third leading cause of death in today's youth. Along with so many other things in the world today, it can be prevented. I have lost friends and family to suicide and never got a reason for why it happened. In this paper, I intend to define suicide, explain how common suicidal behaviors are among males and females, and examine the differences in suicidal tendencies between males and females, causes for suicide, and the ways that it can be prevented.
        Suicide is defined as the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally especially by a person of years of discretion and of sound mind. Many people look at suicide as though it is murder. In some ways, I can see why. The rate of suicide increases every year. Since 1970, the rate of suicide has increased 200%. Over thirty years, that is a big increase for a bad thing. Along with that, 30 to 50 % have seriously considered suicide while 8 to 14% have actually attempted it. The bad thing is that sucicde accounts for
        There are many causes for someone wanting to commit suicide. Depression is one of the leading causes. Depression can have dire consequences if left untreated. If left untreated, depression can lead to suicide. Sometimes it is hard to tell if someone is suffering from depression. Most times, depression will go untreated because the person does not think that there is anything seriously wrong with them. Among most high school and college students, depression is the leading cause for suicide. Even when someone jokingly talks about suicide, it should be taken very seriously. All types of depression are considered a serious illness. Depression can be compared with heart disease or diabetes. It seems like an unlikely comparison, but it shows that depression cannot be taken lightly.

More than 90 percent of species that have lived over the course of Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history are extinct. Our planet has preserved evidence of this incredibly diversity of prehistoric animals in the form of bones, footprints, amber deposits, and other fossil remains.
